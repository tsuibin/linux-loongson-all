 *	     This pointer is required, and it is not acceptable to pass kfree
 *	     in as this function.  If the caller does pass kfree to this
 *	     function, you will be publicly mocked mercilessly by the kref

 *
 * Subtract @count from the refcount, and if 0, call release().
 * Return 1 if the object was removed, otherwise return 0.  Beware, if this
 * function returns 0, you still can not count on the kref from remaining in
 * memory.  Only use the return value if you want to see if the kref is now
 * gone, not present.
